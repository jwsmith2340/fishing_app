# fishing_app_backend

This is my personal fly-fishing digital logbook. It's my first Node-Postgres-Express app, and I plan on hooking 
it up to a React front end. I'm implementing testing via jest and using ESLint for formatting. 

I'm currently working on the backend of this app, so there is nothing live yet.
